## Realistic Random

This is a simple plugin for random lighting control in Indigo.  Unlike other approaches, the plugin will create separate, randomized, wait-ON-wait-OFF cycles for each light it controls.  

This allows for more realistic effects. For example, a bathroom light might turn on more frequently and for shorter periods than a light in the living room.

This approach also means that each light will turn off on it's own independent schedule versus all lights turning off at once.
